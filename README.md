# dotfiles
Environment configuration for macOS and zsh

.zash is my current framework which is somehow outdated but it is still useful for my daily tasks. 

Replace '#FILLIN' or with your username and home folder's name
And the * as passwords by your ones.

## Usage

```
cd ~
git clone http://github.com/victorfuertes/dotfiles.git .
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```
- setup.sh not available due to personal configuration options, please make yours, it's a git clone chmod +x and running of the install scripts.
